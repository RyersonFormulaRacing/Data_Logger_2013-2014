Data_Logger_2013-2014
=====================

Data logger programs for 2013-14 season
This repository includes all programs created by the datalogging system of the Ryerson Formula Racing team.

1.0 Project Organization
------------------------

There are multiple projects that must be completed for the datalogging system to be successful. We will arrange these projects into three groups:

- 1.1 - Essential - the BARE minimum that must be completed to have a working datalogger;
- 1.2 - Expected  - functionality that we and the rest of the team expect;
- 1.3 - Extra     - extra projects that are not necessary or expected.

2.0 Projects
------------

This list of projects will be updated and modified throughout the year.

###2.1 Essential
  - 2.1.1 Daq able to read data during a run####
  - 2.1.2 Daq able to store data during a run
  - 2.1.3 Daq able to transmit data to a computer after a run
  - 2.1.4 Computer able to present data

###2.2 Expected
  - 2.2.1 Daq able to maximize storage effiency
  - 2.2.2 Programming style is modular, easy to read, and easily extended
  - 2.2.3 Computer able to present data in a customized fasion
  - 2.2.4 Menu system and intuitive UI
  - 2.2.5 No Bugs
  - 2.2.6 fail-safe design
  - 2.2.7 Paddle shifting management *Emphasis on fail-safe
  - 2.2.8 Real-time presentation of data to driver on runs (Gear, shift-lights, speed, etc. To be decided)

###2.3 Extra
  - 2.3.1 Daq relays information in real time to laptop in the pits; laptop stores data
  - 2.3.2 Computer able to send custom commands to daq, wirelessly or wired
  - 2.3.3 Radio connection with driver
